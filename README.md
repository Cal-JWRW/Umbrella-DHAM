# Umbrella-DHAM
This repository contains a python implementation of the Dynamic Histogram Analysis Method (DHAM) [1] for the calculation of free energy profiles and permeation coefficients from lipid membrane umbrella sampling simulations. Our implementation

# Limitations
This implementation is built to take GROMACS output files. In particular the *pullx simulation *.log files.
